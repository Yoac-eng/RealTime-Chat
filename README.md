# RealTime-Chat
A real time chat using React, NodeJS and Socket.io

*The focus here is to learn/demonstrate how to work with socket.io and web sockets, so its not connected to a database*

##Installation
Use the following commands on both the server and client folders to install dependencies and run it

You can use the package manager that u prefer:

- Using npm: 
```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
- Using yarn:
```bash
  yarn install
  yarn run dev
```

##How to try it
Once both the server and client are running, you can open two or more browsers and connect to http://localhost:5173/ and check the real time messages working through the socket protocol.
